### What is this repository for? ###
Monks vs. Ninjas. You are a monk. You must fight ninjas. Only you can restore peace to the world. A 2D platformer game in the early stages of development. 

### How do I get set up? ###

MVN is a standard Android project with no external dependencies. Go wild!

### Contribution guidelines ###

If you want to contribute, the best thing to do first is to play the game. You can do this by compiling the game manually using:
    
		ant debug

and then installing it to a connected Android device using:

    adb -d install -r bin/Monk*.apk

You will find that if you are on the master branch, things will be buggier but there will be more to play around with--a hovering indestructible dragon, for instance!
